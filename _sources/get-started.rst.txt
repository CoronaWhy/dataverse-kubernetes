Getting started
===============



Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need a running and fully configured Kubernetes cluster either
using OpenShift, Minikube, a full-fledged Cluster, GKE or similar.

When you want to register datasets and/or files in your deployment to
DataCite, EZID or similar, you will need working accounts to configure.
Otherwise, you might want to use the FAKE provider.
See also: http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html
and https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/5448

Usage
-----

*Quick'n'dirty demo on naked cluster:*
```
kubectl apply -k .
```

.. note::
  - This will of course need a recent `kubectl` and a configured cluster context.
  - This is usable for demo purposes.
  - You really want to [provide a secure admin password](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/secrets.md) for anything serious.

#### Production usage
You should make yourself familiar with a series of documentation articles, linked below:

* [Container images](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/images.md)
* [Persistance storage](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/storage.md)
* [Detailed insight into inner workings](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/how-it-works.md)
* [Using Kubernetes descriptors from this project](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/reuse.md)
* [Configuration of Dataverse](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/config.md)
* [Secrets usage](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/secrets.md)
* [(Custom) Metadata Blocks](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/metadata.md)
* [Maintenance Jobs and Little Helpers](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/little-helpers.md)

Please be aware that this project currently only offers images and support
for basic usage. Integrations are not yet part of this, but may be added as needed.
See also relevant docs within Dataverse guides and upstream projects.

#### Development usage
First, you will need to read up and get familiar with all of the above about production usage.
More details about usage for developing Dataverse below.

* [Development container images](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/images.md#development-images)
* [Prepare toolchain](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/rundev.md#prepare-toolchain)
* [Using local cluster](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/rundev.md#local-cluster)
* [Using remote cluster](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/rundev.md#remote-cluster) (not yet supported)

<summary>If you think this is weird and/or cumbersome:</summary>
As long as K8s usage is not a first class citizen for IQSS, this project should
not (or cannot) be included in Dataverse upstream.

```diff
+ We don't have to deal with upstream merge process for PRs and can move quicker.
+ We can use tools like Skaffold, Kustomization, etc only usable when living at the topmost level.
- We have to deal with `git submodules` and somewhat bloated image builds.
- We cannot use fancy Maven tools like JIB and others.
```
